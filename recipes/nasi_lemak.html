            <p>
                Nasi Lemak is considered Malaysia’s national dish. It consists of fragrant coconut milk-infused rice served with a variety of accompaniments. 
                <br> The rice is creamy and rich, complemented by crispy fried anchovies, peanuts, a hard-boiled egg, and the most essential component: 
                <br> sambal, a spicy chili paste. Nasi Lemak is often eaten for breakfast, but it is beloved at all times of the day
