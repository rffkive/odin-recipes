                Nasi Lemak is considered Malaysia’s national dish. It consists of fragrant coconut milk-infused rice served with a variety of accompaniments. 
                <br> The rice is creamy and rich, complemented by crispy fried anchovies, peanuts, a hard-boiled egg, and the most essential component:
